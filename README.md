# Pixel Match by Adam Weaver

This game was built to get players to test there memory skill. I have styled the game with pixaliated font and images to give it a retro feel. I have a start button to initailise the game. A timer and move set for the player to follow and a stop button when they have finished. When this happens I have a results model that will pop up to give the player their results.

## Font

I used Press Start 2P font style from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?query=Press+Start+) to coinside with the style I was creating. I liked the retro look of the front and found it fitting with the overal design of the game.

## Backgound

I gave the game a background that is fitting witht the overall style. The image was found on google images but would, if had enough time, to create my own artwork.

## Images

All images were sourced from google images. I kept to the pixel style aspect to keep it within the look I was aiming for.

## Features

The game contains only one page. I has a interacting start/stop button to activate the game in different ways.

The timer is activated when a player starts with a move count there to allow the payer to monitor how many turns it has taken them. This gives the player a challange to improve with their pace and winning with less moves.

I also have a results model that will allow the player to se there overall results.

## Room for improvment?

I would like to include more levels to the game, to make it more engaging for a user. This would come in stages and more matching cards could be introduced.
Possibly a leaderboard could be added for users to keep track of there progress. This would require a player details entry and database to store scores.
It could be interesting to change the theme of the levels while the player is progessing for a more imersive playthrough.
